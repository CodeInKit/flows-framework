## üßê About

This project was develop in order to help programmers write code faster and cleaner from the very start.
usually when a new project is created the main focus of the project is speed which sometime cause neglecting the code quality.
also we are not developing alone and sometimes developers don't understand the thousands layers of abstractions and they are confused regarding the location of every piece of code.
this practice usually lead to huge spaghetti mess and with this framework we can avoid it.

## üèÅ Getting Started

We recommend use [@codeinkit/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codeinkit/cli) where the two commands

```
npx @codeinkit/cli generate flows-server
npx @codeinkit/cli generate ws-flows-server
```

create the framework with the folders so developer can use it out of the box.

### Prerequisites

developers should have [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
